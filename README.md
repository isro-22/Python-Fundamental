# Python-Test
Test Python for personal purpose after 4 years doesn't touch coding activity :).
So right now i want to refresh and share about python programming by study case.

## Case-1 : Conditional Branching Statement
A mother requested her son to get food one day. She asked him particularly to buy a bottle of milk. But there was a distinctive request: the mother also wants to purchase some eggs. "If the store has eggs, please buy six of them," she said to her son. After all, him followed his mother's directions and went to the shop.


## Case-2 : Looping using For

You are a store owner who sells various items. Every day, you need to check your remaining stock and determine whether you need to reorder items that are running low. To make things easier, you want to create a program that can process the stock list and provide notifications if the stock of a particular item is below the minimum amount.

**Case Details:**

You have a list of items in your store with their respective stock quantities.
If the stock of an item is below 5, you need to reorder the item.
The program should display the name of the item and the current stock amount, as well as whether it needs to be reordered or not.
